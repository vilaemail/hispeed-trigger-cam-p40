- Fix Camera2DirectEngine and enable choosing it in settings
- Support changing zoom level between wide and 1.0
- Fix clicking on screen to focus that part of the image.
- Fix (if possible) in each of engines such that torch (camera flash) is turned off immediatelly after recording ends (not only after processing ends)
- Definitely know when copying to external drive is finished and let the user know.
- The time shown in text on screen sometimes is very long (milions of miliseconds), do not show these obviously wrong timings.
